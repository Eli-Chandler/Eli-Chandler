# 👋 Hey, I’m Eli

I’m a software engineer with a strong focus on backend development and software architecture. I enjoy designing clean, maintainable systems—thinking about service boundaries, data flow, and how everything scales. I'm also comfortable jumping into frontend work when needed, and I like building end-to-end solutions that actually ship.

### 🧩 What I Do

- Primarily Backend & Cloud
- Can cobble together a frontend when I need to
- Design **scalable, testable systems** with varying architectures
- Tinker with **LLM agents**, **RAG pipelines**, and intelligent automation
- **DevOps** stuff

### ⚙️ Technologies I Like Using
- **Languages**: Python, C#, TypeScript((i've only used react)), Java(maybe a little rusty), SQL
- **Frameworks**: FastAPI, ASP.NET Web API, React, Flask, various ORMs
- **Infra & Tooling**: Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Digital Ocean, Various CI/CD tools
- **Testing**: Prefer integration testing but comfortable with mocking, unit tests and e2e tests

### 🧠 Areas I’m Interested In
- System design and architecture
- Async I/O and concurrency patterns
- very specific aspects of Domain-driven design (please do not get me started on repository pattern)
  - I like encapsulated, rich, meaningful services and entities
  - I don't like three layers of indirection and a RepositoryFactoryBuilder
- Infrastructure as code and testing environments that don't suck
- LLMs in real software workflows (not just chat UIs)
